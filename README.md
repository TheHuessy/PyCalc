# PyCalc
A simple and heavily plagiarized desktop calculator app using PyQt5 to replace Windows 10's Calculator app 

## Why?

In an effort to de-bloatware an installation of Windows 10, I inadvertantly removed the default calculator app. For the last 3 years I've simply been firing up a python shell if I need to do some quick math, but this has been getting more and more annoying and keyboard buttons sometimes try to open the app which isn't there. 

The goal of this is to build out a function, simple calculator with a UI and then convert it to an `exe` file which I will then point Windows to where ever the calculator app is expected. This gives me a good opportunity to get my feet wet with `PyQt` so that I can rely more on Python for desktops apps and less on R Shiny.
